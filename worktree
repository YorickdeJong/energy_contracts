Git Worktree Helper

Usage: ./worktree <command> [arguments]

Commands:
    new <feature-name>          Create a new worktree for a feature branch
    list                        List all worktrees
    remove <feature-name>       Remove a worktree and optionally its branch
    switch <feature-name>       Open the worktree directory (for quick navigation)
    clean                       Remove all worktrees that no longer exist
    help                        Show this help message

Examples:
    ./worktree new user-authentication
